## About Me  
👋 Hello everyone! I'm Amashiro Haruto (天城晴翔). Btw this is my Japanese name, but it is not my real name.

## My Skills  
💻 I'm a developer who loves programming, enjoys challenging myself, and continuously learning new technologies. I’m proficient in the following areas:

- JavaScript/TypeScript (my primary focus)
- Java
- Python
- Full-stack development
- mistakenly treating WebSocket as a RESTful API

I might be a fool for treating WebSocket like a RESTful API. (laugh)

## Projects  
💾 Here are some of my main projects:

- [nekoHaru](https://harutoo.com) - I’m currently developing an all-in-one Discord bot designed to make it easier for administrators to manage their Discord communities.
- [HarutoStudio](https://github.com/HarutoStudio) - Establishing HarutoStudio, where I work on various software development projects.

## Contact  
🐶 I'm dedicated to creating efficient, reliable, and scalable applications, and I’m passionate about researching algorithms.
