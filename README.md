## About Me
👋 Hello everyone! I'm Shiina Haruto (椎名晴翔). Btw this is my Japanese name, but it is not my real name.

## My Skills
💻  I am a passionate developer who loves programming, enjoys challenging myself, and continuously learning new technologies. I work with:

- Node.js
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- Python

I might be a madman for using WebSocket to build server APIs.
